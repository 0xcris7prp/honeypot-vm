This project is build for Trap the hackers from all over the world .

## Brief Overview of Project
The project aims to establish a robust Security Information and Event Management
(SIEM) system within the Microsoft Azure ecosystem, utilizing Azure Sentinel. SIEM
systems are pivotal in modern cybersecurity strategies, offering centralized monitoring,
detection, and response capabilities to safeguard digital assets. By setting up Azure
Sentinel, the project seeks to streamline security operations, enhance threat detection,
and enable proactive incident response within the Azure cloud environment. This
initiative aligns with contemporary cybersecurity best practices, ensuring comprehensive
protection against evolving cyber threats while leveraging the scalability and flexibility
of cloud-based solutions provided by Microsoft Azure.


## Tools and resources utilized
The tools and resources utilized for setting up Azure Sentinel include:
1. Microsoft Azure Portal for managing Azure resources.
2. Azure Sentinel Documentation for guidance.
3. Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates for automation.
4. Data Connectors for ingesting logs.
5. Custom Connectors for integrating with external sources.
6. Security Analytics Rules for defining detection logic.
7. Azure Monitor for collecting telemetry data.
8. Azure Active Directory for monitoring authentication events.
